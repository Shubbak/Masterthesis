	abstract = {The question of nuclear motions associated with electron transitions is discussed from the standpoint of quantum mechanics. It appears that Heisenberg's indetermination principle gives the clue to the inexactness of the earlier method based on Franck's postulate since its strict application calls for a violation of the principle. The existence of an entirely new type of band spectrum due to the wave nature of matter is predicted and the interpretation of Rayleigh's mercury band at 2476-2482 A.U. as of this type is suggested. Finally it is shown that while Franck's postulate is also true for electron jumps in atoms, it is of but trivial interest because its inexactness is much greater for the electrons than for heavy nuclei. © 1928 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Accurate calculations are reported of the radiative lifetimes of the different vibrational levels of the excited and On« states of molecular hydrogen and of the fractions of the absorptions that terminate in the vibrational continuum of the ground electronic state leading to dissociation. For a uniform radiation field with a cutoff at the Lyman limit, the fraction is 22.9 percent for absorption into the B 1 2 u + state and 8.0 X 10-6 percent for absorption into the {OIL} state. Solomon (cf. Field, Somerville, and Dressier 1966) drew attention to the fact that molecular hydrogen can be dissociated by radiation of wavelength shorter than 1109 Â through the sequence of discrete absorption into the vibrational levels v f of the excited electronic state, followed by emission into the vibrational continuum of the ground electronic state. At 1009 Â, the similar process involving the excited C{\textasciicircum}u state becomes energetically possible. Stecher and Williams (1967) demonstrated quantitatively that these processes provide an efficient mode of destruction of H2 in the interstellar medium. Their calculations were based upon the assumption that the relative probability for emission into the continuum is given by the difference from unity of the sum of the discrete Franck-Condon factors. They computed that in a uniform radiation field 11 percent of the absorptions to the state and 6 percent of the absorptions to the C{\textasciicircum}Hu state lead to dissociation. ...},

Both computer programs are based on the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method (J. Chem. Phys. 91 (1989) 3571). The method is exceptionally simple and robust. It relies on using the momentum representation for the kinetic energy operator and the coordinate representation for the potential energy. The first computer program ({FGHEVEN}) is based on an explicit (very simple) expression for the Hamiltonian matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix give the required bound-state energies and the eigenvectors yield directly the eigenfunctions evaluated on the regularly spaced grid points. In this paper the theory has been slightly extended to encompass the situation where an even number of grid points is used. The second program ({FGHFFT}) is based on a complimentary theory which makes use of the discrete fast Fourier transform technique to evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix. The programs are self-contained and include subroutines to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors needed. © 1991.},

	abstract = {The free-complement ({FC}) method is a general method for solving the Schrödinger equation ({SE}): The produced wave function has the potentially exact structure as the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The variables included are determined either by using the variational principle ({FC}-{VP}) or by imposing the local Schrödinger equations ({FC}-{LSE}) at the chosen set of the sampling points. The latter method, referred to as the local Schrödinger equation ({LSE}) method, is integral-free and therefore applicable to any atom and molecule. The purpose of this paper is to formulate the basic theories of the {LSE} method and explain their basic features. First, we formulate three variants of the {LSE} method, the {AB}, {HS}, and {HTQ} methods, and explain their properties. Then, the natures of the {LSE} methods are clarified in some detail using the simple examples of the hydrogen atom and the Hooke's atom. Finally, the ideas obtained in this study are applied to solving the {SE} of the helium atom highly accurately with the {FC}-{LSE} method. The results are very encouraging: we could get the world's most accurate energy of the helium atom within the sampling-type methodologies, which is comparable to those obtained with the {FC}-{VP} method.

In this paper a new variant of {TQR} is developed which is similar to parts of the variant proposed by Sack (1972). This variant has fewer operations than the one in {LAPACK}, which results in faster timings, and it avoids the accuracy problems of the other historical variants.

Spectra have been taken in the exciting-photon energy range between 11 and 18 {eV} for discrete energy steps of 2.5 {meV} at a bandwidth of about 10 {meV}. The exciting-photon energy bandwidth has been narrow enough to induce transitions between individual rovibronic states. The resolution in the dispersed fluorescence detection was partly sufficient to resolve fluorescent transitions between individual rovibronic states. The recorded intensities are presented as two-dimensional photon-excitation photon-emission ({PhexPhem}) maps. They give a complete overview of experimental dispersed {VUV}/ {FUV} fluorescence spectra of H2 for these excitation energies, covering excitation from H2X1Σg+ (v = 0) to all known singly excited states. The presented proof of principle experiments show a way to generate spectroscopic reference data for theory benchmarking and the interpretation of astrophysical observations.},

We also investigate the properties of parameters estimated from fits of statistical models to {sWeighted} data and provide closed formulas for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the fitted parameters.

Both computer programs are based on the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method (J. Chem. Phys. 91 (1989) 3571). The method is exceptionally simple and robust. It relies on using the momentum representation for the kinetic energy operator and the coordinate representation for the potential energy. The first computer program ({FGHEVEN}) is based on an explicit (very simple) expression for the Hamiltonian matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix give the required bound-state energies and the eigenvectors yield directly the eigenfunctions evaluated on the regularly spaced grid points. In this paper the theory has been slightly extended to encompass the situation where an even number of grid points is used. The second program ({FGHFFT}) is based on a complimentary theory which makes use of the discrete fast Fourier transform technique to evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix. The programs are self-contained and include subroutines to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors needed. © 1991.},

Solomon (cf. Field, Somerville, and Dressier 1966) drew attention to the fact that molecular hydrogen can be dissociated by radiation of wavelength shorter than 1109 Â through the sequence of discrete absorption into the vibrational levels v f of the excited electronic state, followed by emission into the vibrational continuum of the ground electronic state. At 1009 Â, the similar process involving the excited C{\textasciicircum}u state becomes energetically possible. Stecher and Williams (1967) demonstrated quantitatively that these processes provide an efficient mode of destruction of H2 in the interstellar medium. Their calculations were based upon the assumption that the relative probability for emission into the continuum is given by the difference from unity of the sum of the discrete Franck-Condon factors. They computed that in a uniform radiation field 11 percent of the absorptions to the state and 6 percent of the absorptions to the C{\textasciicircum}Hu state lead to dissociation. ...},
